Demo Application for applying discount

### Use Case
 On a retail website, the following discounts apply:
 1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount.
 2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount.
 3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount. 
 4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount). 
 5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries. 6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
